# GeoVision Image Calibration 
GeoVision is an algorithm for single-image calibration: it estimates the camera intrinsics and gravity direction from a single image only. By combining geometric optimization with deep learning, GeoVision provides a more flexible and accurate calibration compared to previous approaches. This repository hosts the inference, evaluation, and training code for GeoVision and instructions to download our training set OpenPano.
